# PRODIGY_CS_01
Python Program to implement Caesar Cipher

What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. Named after Julius Caesar, who used it to encode his private messages, the Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down the alphabet. 

For example, with a shift of 3:
- A becomes D
- B becomes E
- C becomes F
- and so on.

So, the word "HELLO" encrypted with a shift of 3 would become "KHOOR".

The Caesar cipher is easy to implement but also easy to break because there are only 25 possible shifts (excluding the trivial case of a shift of 0), making it vulnerable to brute force attacks. Despite its simplicity, it's a good introduction to the concepts of encryption and decryption.
